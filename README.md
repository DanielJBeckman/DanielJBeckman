## 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm Daniel—a highly creative AI/ML engineer and prototyping lead with experience across multiple USGS labs:  
**Enterprise Technology Office (ETO), Hydrologic Applied Innovation Lab (HAIL), and Web Informatics and Mapping (WIM).**  

I specialize in:
- Computer vision and embedded AI systems
- Environmental sensing and scientific data visualization
- Creative XR/VR/AR projects and mobile CV apps

I'm also growing fast in platform engineering: writing secure Airflow DAGs, working in Kubernetes-based infra, and contributing to GitLab CI/CD deployments in a production environment.
